In order to make the proposed system work, collectd clients must be installed on all nodes of the distributed system and the monitoring server must host a collectd server.

Before starting with the installation, the following symbolic link must be created as collectd is unable to locate the libjvm.so file. Based
on your java installation, execute the one that seems relevant. If you have been following our repository for the system setup, then we
highly recommend you work with the same java versions as given below. ONly these versions have been tested for compatibility with the
the entire end-to-end system.

ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so /usr/lib/libjvm.so
or
ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/server/libjvm.so /usr/lib/libjvm.so


Now, below are the steps for installing collect client and server:

1. Collect Client

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install collectd 
sudo apt-get install collectd-utils


Replace the collectd.conf file found in ./etc/collectd/collectd.conf with the one provided in this repository (named collectd_client.conf). 
After replacing, rename this file to collectd.conf. You can take a backup of the old file, just in case. After that, certain changes 
need to be made.

1. In order to send the collect metric data to the server, we need to provide a the IP address of the server. This can be done by the loading the 
<bold>Network Plugin <bold> of collectd. Here, the IP address must be changed to the IP address of your monitoring server.
2. Uncomment any of the other metric data, in case you wish to collect that too.

After doing this, browse to /var/lib folder. You should see a csv (if you enabled csv plugin) and rrd folder. This means that your 
installation was successful.

2.Collectd Server

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install collectd 
sudo apt-get install collectd-utils

Replace the collectd.conf file found in ./etc/collectd/collectd.conf with the one provided in this repository (named collectd_server.conf). 
After replacing, rename this file to collectd.conf. You can take a backup of the old file, just in case. After that, certain changes 
need to be made.

1. Go to the <bold>Network Plugin <bold> of collectd and change the IP address to your monitoring server IP address. Ensure you use
the same network interface. If you make any changes on that front, ensure that the client is able to ping the server at the
configured IP.

After doing this, browse to /var/lib folder. You should see a folder for each of your configured clients. On
opening the folder, you should be able to see a csv (if you enabled csv plugin) and rrd folder. This means that your 
installation was successful.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and configured Collectd client and server.
